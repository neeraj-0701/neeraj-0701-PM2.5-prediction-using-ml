# AIR QUALITY PM2.5 PREDICTION MODEL USING MACHINE LEARNING AND FLASK WEB APP
## 1. Project Title / Headline
🌫️ **Air Quality PM2.5 Prediction Web App**  
A Flask-based, interactive web application that predicts PM2.5 levels in the environment using machine learning, helping users monitor air pollution trends in real-time.

---

## 2. Short Description / Purpose
The Air Quality PM2.5 Prediction Web App is designed to provide quick and accurate predictions of PM2.5 levels using user-provided air quality parameters. This tool is intended for environmental analysts, health researchers, urban planners, and citizens who want to understand and respond to air pollution in their area.
